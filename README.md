# Python OOPs: Attributes Storage and Retrieval System

A log parsing and metrics storage/retrieval system for high-frequency trading (HFT) environments using advanced Python OOP principles.

## Project Overview

This project implements a robust system for log parsing and metrics storage/retrieval designed for monitoring high-frequency trading environments but applicable to any log-based metrics collection scenario. It showcases modern Python OOP principles including abstract classes, inheritance, generics, and design patterns.

## Dependencies

This project only uses standard Python libraries, so no additional packages are required. Just make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed.

## Key Components

### 1. Attribute System
- Abstract base class `Attribute[T]` with generic type parameter
- Concrete implementations:
  - `NumericAttribute`: For numeric values (PnL, RAM usage)
  - `CountAttribute`: For counting occurrences (warnings, errors)
  - `AccumulatorAttribute`: For accumulating values (sleep time)
  - `ComplexAttribute`: For complex metrics (latency quartiles)

### 2. Log Processing
- Efficient log processing with caching
- Pattern matching and value extraction
- Support for different types of log formats

### 3. Evaluation System
- Customizable evaluator functions for each attribute
- Support for criticality levels (CRITICAL, RELAXED)
- Status results (OK, WARNING, ERROR)

### 4. Storage System
- Database abstraction layer
- Support for metadata persistence
- Data retrieval capabilities

### 5. User Interface
- Interactive CLI demo application
- Command-line argument support
- Comprehensive error handling

## OOP Design Features

### Abstract Classes and Inheritance
- `Attribute` abstract base class
- Concrete attribute type hierarchies

### Generics
- Type variables for type-safe attributes (`T` in `Attribute[T]`)
- Generic method implementations

### Encapsulation
- Protected attributes with property access
- Clear separation of concerns

### Design Patterns
- **Registry Pattern**: Global access to attribute instances
- **Strategy Pattern**: Customizable evaluator functions
- **Singleton Pattern**: Registry implementation
- **Factory Methods**: Creating attributes from database records

## Running the Demo

### Interactive CLI
```bash
python main.py
```
Provides a command-line interface for interactive processing and database operations with the following commands:
- `process <logfile>` - Process a log file and extract metrics
- `save <db_name>` - Save current metrics to database
- `help` - Show help information
- `exit` - Exit the program

### Direct Log Processing
```bash
python main.py --logfile external_sample.log
```
Processes the specified log file and shows extracted metrics and evaluation results.

## Example Use Case

The system successfully processes a sample log file, extracts metrics, stores them in a database, and evaluates them against previous values. It demonstrates how monitoring systems can use this framework to detect anomalous conditions in trading systems.

For example, when processing the included `external_sample.log` file:
1. It extracts error counts, warning counts, and response times
2. It evaluates these metrics against defined thresholds
3. It detects when error counts exceed critical thresholds
4. It provides status indicators (‚úÖ, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üö®) for quick assessment

## Extending the System

To add a new attribute type:

1. Create a new class extending `Attribute[T]`
2. Implement the required abstract methods
3. Register instances in the registry
4. Use in your application

For example:

```python
class BooleanAttribute(Attribute[bool]):
    # Implement abstract methods...
    pass
```

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how Python's OOP features can be leveraged to create a modular, extensible system for log processing and metrics extraction. The design emphasizes reusability, type safety, and clear separation of concerns.
